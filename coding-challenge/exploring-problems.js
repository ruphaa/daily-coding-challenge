Problem 1
Given an array of words, return the words that can be typed using letters of only one row on a keyboard.
Extra credit: Include the option for a user to pick the type of keyboard they are using (ANSI, ISO, etc)!

Example:
oneRow([‘candy’, ‘doodle’, ‘pop’, ‘shield’, ‘lag’, ‘typewriter’])
[‘pop’, ‘lag’, ‘typewriter’]
